# What
This folder contains some code refactoring materials, that I found really useful over the years. It is sorted by language and contains readme file with materials on specific topics.

# Why
Over the years, I have found that on specific languages you face the same type of problems and they have same type of treatment. Oftentimes, they are pretty specific, that you can apply easily. I wanted to have a single repository of such methods that I can share as examples instead of explaining it 100th time.

# How
You can find all of the code examples in each language folder.
