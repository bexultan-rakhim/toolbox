# Toolbox
## What
This is my software engineers toolbox, that contains following:
* Some common methodologies
* Design patterns
* Code refactoring strategies
* Some repeated scripts and tools that solve same old problems

## Why
Over the years, I have accumulated some useful experiences on software engineering and I wanted to have a single place to index it and make it easy to share. I got tired of repeating same old stories again, and reimplementing same solutions to same old problems. This repository is for such knowledge sharing.

## How
I am planning to gradually add more material as I go. You can look around and see what already exists.
