# toolbox
## What
This is my software engineers toolbox, that containes following:
* Some common methodologies
* Desing patterns
* Code refactoring strategies
* Some repeated scripts that solve same old problems

## Why
Over the years, I have accumulated some knowledge on software enginering andiI wanted to have a single place to index it and make it easy to share. I got tired of repeating same knowledge again and again, and reimplementing same solutions to some of the same old problems. So, good cheff has sharp tools.

## How
I am planning to gradually add more material as I go. You can look around and see what already exists.
